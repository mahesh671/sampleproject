    <h1><em>Intro to personality</em></h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            An individualâ€™s personality is the combination of traits and patterns that influence their behavior, thought, motivation, and emotion. It drives individuals to consistently think, feel, and behave in specific ways; in essence, it is what makes each individual unique. Over time, these patterns strongly influence personal expectations, perceptions, values, and attitudes.

            Personality psychology is the study of human personality and how it varies among individuals and populations. <strong>Personality has been studied for over 2000 years</strong>, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE and spanning through modern theories such as the psychodynamic perspective and trait theory.<span><img src="website/mahesh.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Mahesh"></span>

        <h2>Type theories</h2>

<ul><li> An early form of personality type indicator theory was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Temperaments" >Four Temperaments system</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen" >Galen</a>, based on the four humours model of Hippocrates; an extended five temperaments system based on the classical theory was published in 1958.</li>
    <li>One example of personality types is Type A and Type B personality theory. According to this theory, impatient, achievement-oriented people are classified as Type A, whereas easy-going, relaxed individuals are designated as Type B. The theory originally suggested that Type A individuals were more at risk for coronary heart disease, but this claim has not been supported by empirical research.</li>
<li>One study suggests that people with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_A_and_Type_B_personality_theory">Type A personalities are more likely to develop personality disorders whereas Type B personalities</a> are more likely to become alcoholics.[12]</li>
